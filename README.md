# ðŸ¤– Practical Multi AI Agents and Advanced Use Cases with crewAI

## ðŸ“˜ Course Overview

[**Practical Multi AI Agents and Advanced Use Cases with crewAI**](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/practical-multi-ai-agents-and-advanced-use-cases-with-crewai/) is a hands-on course led by JoÃ£o Moura (Founder of CrewAI) that teaches you how to build and deploy intelligent, multi-agent systems using the **crewAI** framework.

The course equips developers and AI practitioners with skills to design, implement, and manage collaborative AI agents for real-world, production-grade use casesâ€”ranging from sales automation to support analytics and content creation.

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Objectives
- Design agentic workflows with parallel, sequential, and hybrid logic.
- Integrate agents with internal & external systems (e.g., Trello, APIs).
- Leverage multiple LLMs and tools per agent.
- Evaluate and train agent performance using testing & feedback loops.
- Prepare and deploy multi-agent systems for production.

- Serper (if used)
- Trello (for integrations)

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
TRELLO_API_KEY=your-key
...
```

### 3. Run Any Notebook

- Open notebooks in Jupyter or VS Code.
- Execute cells sequentially to see agents collaborate.
- Some flows support CLI execution (`crewai run`).
